# Glass-Detector

This project classifies the type of glasses based on the values of the input parameters.
This data is easily available on Kaggle website and can be downloaded from there.
This is an classification problem where our Machine Learning model will classify the type of glass used.

To run this project, run the Glass_Classification.ipynb file in either Jupyter notebook or in Google Colabs notebook using either Pthon 2 or 3 environment.

Classification models used in this datasets are-
1. LogisticRegresssion Classifier
2. Support Vector Machine Classifier
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Randomforest Classifier
